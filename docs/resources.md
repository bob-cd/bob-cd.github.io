# Resources

A Resource is a pre-requisite for a command in a Step.

Resource is a term used to describe an external requirement that is needed before a step
can be executed successfully, e.g. source code which needs to be continuously integrated and delivered.

To denote that a particular step needs a resource:

```json
{
  "cmd": "sbt test",
  "needs_resource": "my-scala-src"
}
```

This resource must be declared in the `resources` section of the Pipeline definition.

Each entry consists of the following keys:

- `name`: String, Required: The unique name of the resource by which its to be referred in the `needs_resource` key of a step.
- `type`: String, Required: This can either be `internal` or `external`. External resources are to be fetched from a Resource Provider, whereas Internal ones are outputs of another pipeline in the system. Resources are loaded lazily when required, so if a declared resource isnâ€™t used in a step, it will not be fetched and if fetched will be cached for the remainder of the steps.

Conditional keys:

If type is `external`:

- `params`: Map[String, Any], Required: This are the params that are to be sent to the Resource Provider when requesting the resource. These are a property of that particular provider and helps in customizing the kind of resource fetched.

If type is `internal`:

- `params`: Map[String, Any], Required: This are the params that are to be sent to the [Artifact](https://bob-cd.github.io/pages/concepts/artifact.html) Store when requesting the resource. Since Bob is going to request an artifact from a previous build, it simply calls the corresponding Artifact Store with the `group`, `name`, `run_id` of the artifact that was produced. The `name` of the artifact must be same as the `name` of the resource.
- `provider`: In this case this becomes the name of the registered Artifact Store.

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "my-source",
    "type": "external",
    "provider": "github-provider",
    "params": {
      "repo": "https://github.com/bob-cd/bob",
      "branch": "main"
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "my-ml-model",
    "type": "internal",
    "provider": "s3",
    "params": {
      "group": "dev",
      "name": "make-model",
      "run_id": "r-0ef66ba9-e397-461b-a6d9-f52f91889264"
    }
  }
]
```

A Resource can be used fetch _any_ external items which may be needed in a build.
This is provided to Bob via a Resource Provider.

## Resource Provider

A Resource Provider is Bob's way of abstracting itself from knowing about _how_ to fetch
various resources.

The most general use case for a resource provider is to clone source code that is to be
continuously integrated and delivered.

A Resource Provider is any system which has the following properties:

- It is a web server.
- It is reachable from the network that Bob is in.
- Exposes an endpoint at `/bob_resource` upon which when a `GET` request is made, a `tar` archive is sent back. The rationale for using the tar format is:
  - Its quite ubiquitous and can be implemented with relative ease as its part of the stdlib of various languages.
  - Generally resources tend to be source code and have multiple files/folders and
    using an archive makes it easy to send multiple things.
  - Bob uses Podman as its orchestrator and follows its design decision of using tar files to send things over.
- Exposes a `GET /ping` endpoint which serves as a periodic health check from Bob.

A reference resource provider which handles simple Github pulls can be [found](https://github.com/bob-cd/resource-git)

This gives the following advantages:

- Bob doesn't have to care about _how_ to fetch a particular Resource nor does it have to care about _what_
  the resource is.
- Using a resource provider details like auth, permissions and in cases like source control, things pertaining
  to private repositories, user access etc can be offloaded outside of Bob.
- Multiple instances of Bob can share a resource provider.
- Pretty much any source of data can be abstracted specially the various Version Control Systems.
- The Resource Provider can be written in any language, can scale independently of Bob and be
  registered at runtime with Bob.

A resource provider **must** be registered with Bob prior to the execution of a Step that needs a resource.

To register a Resource provider with Bob:

- Make a `POST` request on the end point `/resource-providers/<name>` with the body:
  ```json
  {
    "url": "https://my-awesome-resources.bob.io"
  }
  ```
- A `202` response from Bob indicates success.
  Here `name` is the unique name with which Bob identifies this. The url must be reachable from Bob.

Conversely a `DELETE` request on `/resource-providers/<name>` un-registers it from Bob.

To list registered resource providers make a `GET` request on `/resource-providers`.
