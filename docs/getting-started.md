# Getting Started

This document is meant to help you to run Bob locally on some popular platforms

## Running Bob on other platforms

Checkout the [bob-deploy](https://github.com/bob-cd/bob-deploy) repo for reference deployments on various platforms

## Running a local Bob cluster on Podman or Docker

To get a minimal setup running locally (with a simple Github public repo and file system based storage), we will run [bob](https://github.com/bob-cd/bob), [resource-git](https://github.com/bob-cd/resource-git) and [artifact-store](https://github.com/bob-cd/artifact-local).

1. Download [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation) or [Rootless Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/)
1. Fetch this [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/bob-cd/bob-deploy/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file with `curl -LfO 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bob-cd/bob-deploy/main/docker-compose.yml'`
1. In the same directory, start the cluster using [podman-compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose#installation) or [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):
   ```bash
   podman-compose up
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
1. When it all comes up, bob should be available on port `7777`

### Using the API

Bob exposes itself fully via a REST API as described [here](https://bob-cd.github.io/pages/api-reference.html)
HTTP clients like [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) etc could be used to directly interact with the [API](api.md).

We would be using [Wendy](https://github.com/bob-cd/wendy), the reference CLI.

### Building a simple project on Bob

This assumes the above steps have been followed and a Bob cluster is available on `http://localhost:7777` and Wendy is set up.

- Test if Bob is ready:
   ```bash
   wendy cluster ping
   ```
   should respond with a `Pong` if all good.
- Create a pipeline manifest and set the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` [values](https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment) according to your OS:
   ```yaml title="pipeline.yaml" linenums="1"
    apiVersion: wendy.bob.cd/v1alpha1
    kind: Pipeline
    identifiedBy:
      - group
      - name
    spec:
      group: dev
      name: pipeline1
      image: docker.io/library/golang:alpine
      steps:
        - needs_resource: source
          cmd: go test
        - needs_resource: source
          vars:
            GOOS: linux
            GOARCH: amd64
          cmd: go build -o app
          produces_artifact:
            name: app
            path: app
            store: artifact-local
      resources:
        - name: source
          type: external
          provider: resource-git
          params:
            repo: https://github.com/lispyclouds/bob-example
            branch: main
   ```
- Create the pipeline:
   ```bash
   wendy apply -m pipeline.yaml
   ```
- Create a resource_provider manifest in a file `resource_provider.yaml`
  ```yaml title="resource_provider.yaml" linenums="1"
    apiVersion: wendy.bob.cd/v1alpha1
    kind: ResourceProvider
    identifiedBy:
      - name
    spec:
      name: resource-git
      url: http://resource-git:8000
  ```
- Register the resource provider:
   ```bash
   wendy apply -m resource_provider.yaml
   ```
- Create an artifact_store manifest in a file `artifact_store.yaml`
  ```yaml title="artifact_store.yaml" linenums="1"
    apiVersion: wendy.bob.cd/v1alpha1
    kind: ArtifactStore
    identifiedBy:
      - name
    spec:
      name: artifact-local
      url: http://artifact-local:8001
  ```
- Register the artifact store:
   ```bash
    wendy apply -m artifact_store.yaml
   ```
- Start the pipeline:
   ```bash
   wendy pipelines start --group dev --name pipeline1
   ```
   should respond with a run id like this:
   ```json
    "r-0ef66ba9-e397-461b-a6d9-f52f91889264"
   ```
   This is like a tracing id, all subsequent interactions can be done with this.
- Follow the events of the run via [SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events):
   ```bash
   wendy events stream
   ```
   should respond with JSON encoded events, hit ctrl-c to close it:
   ```json
   {"run-id":"r-0ef66ba9-e397-461b-a6d9-f52f91889264","type":"pipeline","event":"pull","group":"dev","name":"pipeline1","timestamp":1699339368930}
   ```
   This is ideal for UIs/CLIs reacting to changes in the cluster.
- Check the pipeline status with the run id:
   ```bash
   wendy pipelines status --id r-0ef66ba9-e397-461b-a6d9-f52f91889264
   ```
   should respond:
   ```json
    "running"
   ```
- See the logs of the run at any time:
   ```bash
   wendy pipeline logs --id r-0ef66ba9-e397-461b-a6d9-f52f91889264 --offset 0 --lines 50
   ```
- If all goes well, eventually it should respond with a `passed` status with the same status call as above.
- Download the produced artifact:
   ```bash
   wendy pipelines fetch-artifact --group dev --name pipeline1 --id r-0ef66ba9-e397-461b-a6d9-f52f91889264 --store-name artifact-local --artifact-name app
   ```
- Extract the TAR file:
   ```bash
   tar xvf app.tar
   ```
- Test the executable file. Running following command should give "Hello Casey"
   ```bash
   ./app
   ```

See what else is possible using `wendy --help`.
